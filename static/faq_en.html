    <h2>Some articles garbled?</h2>
    <p class="answer">For custom rss and built-books without encoding specified, program detects encoding automatically by using chardet module of python, this module is not 100% accurate, and if encoding detected is wrong, the article may be garbled. Because this situation is very rare, KindleEar only supply a not very elegant solution like geeker: manually change chardet-detect encoding saved in database. steps follows:<br /> 
    <ol><li>login appid.appspot.com by using account 'admin'(assuming your application name is appid).</li>
    <li>input url 'https://appid.appspot.com/dbviewer' in your brower address bar. check encoding of websites in section UrlEncoding. if encoding is wrong for some site, record its ID of database item.</li>
        <li>enter a long string in addressbar of brower, 'https://appid.appspot.com/dbviewer?action=modurlenc&id=dbid&feedenc=fenc&pageenc=penc'
        <ul>before press enter, modify some vaiable follows:
            <li>dbid: the ID of database item.</li>
            <li>fenc: new correct FeedEncoding.</li>
            <li>penc: new correct PageEncoding.</li>
        </ul></li>
    <li>A method alternate is that change them in 'Datastore viewer' in GAE backend.</li>
    <li>You can obtain the correct encoding by viewing source code of a webpage.</li>
        </ol>
        </p>

    <h2>How can I do if forgot password?</h2>
    <p class="answer">If you have forgotten the password for non-administrator account, you can notify the administrator to change your password. If an administrator password forgot, you can login appengine.google.com, on the left select "Datastore Admin", delete all KeUser data, all account information will be deleted, and then re-use admin/admin login to your application . Did not find "Datastore Admin"? You can active it in the "Application Settings".
        <br />If you know python, you would find other solution.</p>
